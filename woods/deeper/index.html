  <p>The wood is thick and silent now. The leaves above you
completely blocks the sky filtering the light as a deep
green. There are few sounds other than the occasional
creaking of the trees in the wind. </p>
<p>The edges of your vision are also strange here as though you
are looking through a telescope. Details at the edge are
very hard to hold onto and seem to fade away. The center
grows to fill your view and consumes your attention. It is
very difficult to get a clear picture. Traveling along the
trail becomes monotonous and seems to be the incorrect
speed. You imagine communicating here would be difficult.</p>
<h2 id="continue-along-the-path"><a href="https://kaylees.dev/woods/">Continue Along the Path</a></h2>
<p>After a bit, you realize you've stopped progressing forward
and gotten distracted. It takes some effort to continue
moving forward but with some attention you think you'd be
able to.</p>
