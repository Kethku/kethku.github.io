Today I spent my free time after work planning with a friend for my next game
project. I suspect it will be a longer effort than my previous game projects, so
I want to get the planning right.

As mentioned in my Month end review, I reserve the right to do smaller posts
occasionally, so today I will play that card. Tomorrow I will have a fuller post either working on Tetris Attack some more or laying out V1 for the new project.

Till tomorrow,  
Keith
