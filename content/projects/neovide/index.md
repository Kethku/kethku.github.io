## What

This is a Neovim GUI I wrote in Rust based on skia to enable fast and terminal like access to vim with convenient
graphical improvements which make it easier to track what is going on.

## Why

I use Neovim any time I want to edit text. However given that I use windows, the terminal support has historically not
been super great (although it is getting better). So I have been working on a GUI written in Rust which enables
ligatures in the fonts, an animated cursor, and smooth pixel scrolling whenever the buffer scroll position jumps. Its
been wildly more popular than I expected it would be.
