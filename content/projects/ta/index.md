## What

I am making a remake of Tetris Attack for the Super Nintendo.

## Why

I broadly concider Tetris Attack to be my favorite game of all time, and I have
wished there was a good mobile compatible version of it which could take
advantage of more intuitive controls. This is my attempt at such a remake.

## How

The current version of the game can be found
[here](https://kethku.github.io/TetrisAttackClone/). Eventually this site should
support playing the original game in an endless mode, as well as verses another
human, but it will probably be a while.
