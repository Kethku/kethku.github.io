![Todo](./todo.svg)

Starting on February 7th 2019 I embarked on an adventure to make tangible and
documented progress on a project every day for a month. I started this project
after being frustrated with lack luster progress on my personal projects and
after looking through the archives of [Beeple's Daily
Posts](https://www.beeple-crap.com/everydays). I was greatly impressed by the
consistency and sense of progress shown in his work, and decided to try my hand
at something similar, but for programming.

The initial commitment is to do a daily blog post on something programming
related every day for a month, and then re-evaluate. Being 12 days in at the
time of writing this though, I can already say I am finding the project
extremely satisfying and I hope I will continue.

The archive containing all of the daily posts can be found
[here](http://02credits.com/blog/).

## Dev Log

Some of the daily posts will be somewhat meta about the project, and about
improvements to the site. I will log them here.
