Short post just to capture that I cut a Neovide release
using the instructions that @multisn8 wrote at Neovide.dev
for making reproducible releases. I appreciate their work on
making Neovide sustainable so very much. When I had to step
away from the project due to family troubles and then my
work at Zed, @multisn8 stepped up in a big way and guided
the project.

Neovide isn't my effort anymore. Its a project owned and
lead by the community. I couldn't be more proud.

Neovide 0.10.4 is available now in the release page.

Till tomorrow,  
Kaylee
