You are climbing the mighty hemlock. It is much taller than
its siblings and appears clearer of purpose as it grows
straight into the sky without bending.

## [Head to the Lookout](@/trio/hemlock/lookout.md)

Being the tallest of the trees, you easily have the best
vantage point. However here it is still blocked by the bows
of hemlock greenery. Farther up you see a platform woven
from the branches which you might be able to see better
from.

## [Examine the Map](@/trio/hemlock/projects/_index.md)

Nestled into its branches are pots made from terracotta clay
presumably collected from the banks of nearby streams you
can hear in the distance. From these planters grows vines of
ivy and great spilling mounds of lichen. Both hang lazily
from the upper branches down to the two sibling trees below
linking various points of interest with clear
intentionality.

At this point there is a great panel of wood carved out of
the side of the Hemlock and sanded smooth. Burned into the
panel is a map that matches the branches above and below.
