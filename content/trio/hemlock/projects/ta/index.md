## What

I am making a remake of Tetris Attack for the Super Nintendo.

## Why

I broadly consider Tetris Attack to be my favorite game of
all time, and I have wished there was a good mobile
compatible version of it which could take advantage of more
intuitive controls. This is my attempt at such a remake.

## How

The current version of the game can be found
[here](https://kaylees.dev/TetrisAttackClone/dist/index.html).
Eventually this site should support playing the original
game in an endless mode, as well as verses another human,
but it will probably be a while.
