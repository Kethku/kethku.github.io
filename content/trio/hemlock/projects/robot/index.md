## What

I am making an automation centered game based for iOS. The basic premise is to
build a systems automation game where things are automated by building
rudimentary programs out of simple blocks. As the player progresses more blocks
are unlocked allowing the user to automate more and more things and do more
complicated tasks.

## Why

A friend of mine and I have had a game idea rattling around for a couple years
now, and now that I've gotten into a bit of a groove with dailies I think now
might be the time to seriously concider working on it.

## How

Not really sure yet. Just getting started.
