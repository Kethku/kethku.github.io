![Todo](./todo.svg)

I originally started this project after being frustrated with lack luster progress
on my personal projects and after looking through the archives of [Beeple's Daily
Posts](https://www.beeple-crap.com/everydays). I was greatly impressed by the
consistency and sense of progress shown in his work, and decided to try my hand
at something similar, but for programming.

Starting on February 7th 2019 I embarked on an adventure to make tangible and
documented progress on a project every day for a month. I ended up writing daily
posts consistently for 2 months, and then off and on for about 30 more posts 
after that.

In total I wrote 96 posts in what I am now calling Season 1 of my daily blog post
effort. Although I did not continue the project indefinitely, I consider that first
attempt to be a great success! I reinvigorated my interest in programming during
a time when I was struggling to get the motivation to work on things.

That time has come again. I'm feeling drained and tired by the tech industry and
by current events. So over the next month, over 4 years since the last time I
tried this, I will be writing daily blog posts on something programming related.
If all goes well, I may continue after that.

The archive containing all of the daily posts from my last attempt can be found
[here](@/trio/oak/_index.md).

## Dev Log

Some of the daily posts will be somewhat meta about the project, and about
improvements to the site. I will log them here.
