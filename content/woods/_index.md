As you walk through the woods along the path, the trail
takes many turns and you quickly lose your sense of
direction. You don't seem to mind that much though as the
woods is peaceful. Many squirrels and birds make soft noises
and somewhere in the distance you hear a trickling stream
though you don't see it from here.

## [Return to The Trees](@/_index.md)
Occasionally you catch a glimpse up hill of the towering
trees that you realize are in the center of the woods. Its
obvious that they are much larger than any of the other
trees growing in the woods.

## [Continue deeper into the woods](@/woods/deeper.md)
In the other direction you notice the woods getting thicker
and quieter. What was bright, airy and green becomes darker
and stifling. Though not oppressive, you find yourself
looking toward the brighter sections more and more.
