The map is extremely detailed and appears to be carefully
burned into the wood. In places the surface of the panel is
a deep color and is warn with age and is smooth from
constant tracing of fingers. In others it looks brighter as
though somebody had come along and sanded it smooth in order
to burn another pattern in or make adjustments.

At the top of the center tree you can see markers that match
the locations of the clay pots you noticed earlier. By each
pot is a date and a short description of the project they
link to. In a column to the side you see more details of
each project and directions to follow the efforts through
the trees.
