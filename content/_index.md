title = "The Trees"
+++

You are at the base of 3 trees; a Hemlock, an Oak, and a
Maple. The Oak and the Maple's trunks spiral around the
center Hemlock making paths that you could follow. You
estimate that 25 feet up, the three trees branch apart
into isolated canopies.

At the base of the trees is a wooden sign with the following
written on it:

> Hi! I'm Kaylee. I'm a women of trans experience and this
> is my website. I am also a software developer who has
> worked on a number of things including Formal
> Verification, Program Synthesis, Developer Tooling, and
> some light Game Development. This is a place where I
> express myself and document my projects. Please explore
> and enjoy!

## [Climb the Spiral](@/fork.md)
With some effort you could follow the spiral path up to the
fork of the 3 trees and get a closer look at each of the
individually. Along the trunks of the spiralling Oak and
Maple are a couple branches that arc up like a hand rail and
the bark of bunches up periodically like steps leading
upward.

## [Push Out Into the Woods](@/woods.md)
Moving your attention away from The Trees, you notice that
they are growing in a short clearing at the top of a slight
hill that acts to isolate them from the other trees of the
larger forest. Directly opposite the sign at the base of the
trio is a rough trail leading off into the woods.
