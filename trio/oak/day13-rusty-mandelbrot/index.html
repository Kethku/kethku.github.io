      Executing Rust Code in the Browser

      <a href="../../hemlock/projects/blog/">Project Page</a>
    
    </p>
    
  </summary>
  <p>Today I decided to lay some groundwork for future projects. I hope in the future
have more interactive content in these daily posts in order to demonstrate the
concepts more effectively. These days running code in the browser is much easier
than it has been historically. The advent of WebAssembly has opened doors that
previously have been closed. Running anything from the simplest lua script to
the the most complex of Rust or c++ code can now be done in the browser.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I decided to build a simple demo of compiling a library in
WebAssembly to be used in the browser. To make this as easy as possible I used
<a href="https://parceljs.org/">Parcel</a> which is the new darling bundler in the
JavaScript community. Parcel promises zero configuration bundling, but as you
will see shortly, this isn't really true if you stray from the happy path.</p>
<p>The demo I built was a simple Mandelbrot viewer:</p>
<script src="./index.js"></script>
<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; max-width: 8.5in; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
  <div>
    <canvas id="canvas" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
  </div>
  <div>
    <button onclick="draw()">Redraw</button>
  </div>
</div>
<p>The actual complex number calculations are done in rust compiled to a
WebAssembly module which gets automatically imported and initialized by the
Parcel runtime. I will describe the steps to get to this point.</p>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<p>Tools that need installed:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/">Yarn</a></li>
<li><a href="https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html">Parcel</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Once they are installed, I started a new project with parcel by creating a
folder, and adding an index.rs file:</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">#[no_mangle]
pub fn mandle() -&gt; i32 {
  42
}</code>
</pre>
<p>Any function that you intend to expose to the outside world must
have the <code>no_mangle</code> attribute in order to tell the Rust compiler not to
optimize this function away.</p>
<p>To access the file, I created a simple index.js file:</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">import { mandle } from &#x27;.&#x2F;index.rs&#x27;;

console.log(mandle());</code>
</pre>
<p>And lastly a scaffold in an index.html file to actually see something:</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;.&#x2F;index.js&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;script&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;body&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;html&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>Then bundling and compiling is really as simple as running <code>parcel index.html</code>
in your favorite shell.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">Server running at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:1234
âˆš  Built in 722ms.</code>
</pre>
<p>Going to the reported URL will open a blank page, but the dev console should
show 42.</p>
<h2 id="why-webassembly">Why WebAssembly</h2>
<p>Lets get something on the screen shall we? The Mandelbrot fractal is a
fascinating quirk of polynomial multiplication which appears when you plot the
time it takes for the function Z = Z * Z + C to diverge to infinity over various
points (C) on the complex plane. This will make more sense shortly but first a
note on why to use compiled languages in the browser.</p>
<p>Most of the excitement I have seen around WebAssembly centers around the
possibility of significant performance gain when using it. Although this may be
true, the thing that excites me is the possibility of using more expressive, and
safe languages. I find JavaScript very valuable for quick and dirty projects,
but when projects get more complicated than a few thousand lines long, I find
myself relying more and more on the type system of my favorite languages to keep
me sane.</p>
<p>And even beyond that, most of the languages I reach for have significant tools
for building DSL's or domain specific languages within the syntax of the
language. An extremely simplified version of DSL design can be achieved through
operator overloading.</p>
<p>Back to the original goal; the Mandelbrot fractal is much easier to render if we
can use a simple arithmetic DSL for adding and multiplying complex numbers. We
don't need much, but it is very useful to abstract away the complexities of the
algebra and write the code for the actual Mandelbrot function (Z = Z * Z + C)
directly. First lets define our algebra.</p>
<h2 id="complex-numbers">Complex Numbers</h2>
<p>Complex Numbers is a scary name for a relatively simple concept. The idea is to
invent a new number defined as the square root of -1. Clearly no such number
really exists, but if you can imagine it existing, some interesting features
would arise. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Since the square root of any number n multiplied by itself
equals n, multiplying our imaginary number (hence forth i) by itself will get
you -1. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since we don't really know how to factor i, the smallest
simplification we can do with a multiple of i is leave it alone. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hang in there, we are almost to the good part. A complex number is defined as a
group of two numbers. A normal number like what we are used to, and some
multiple of our imaginary number i. Given point number 2, we can't really do
anything fancy with the i part to combine it with the normal number, so we have
to keep them separate. Mathematicians call the normal number the <code>real</code> component
and the multiple of i the <code>imaginary</code> component</p>
<p>So any complex number has two parts, a real part which can be any <code>real</code> number,
and an <code>imaginary</code> part which is some multiple of i. The last thing we can know
before we get pretty pictures is that we can add and multiply complex numbers
together.</p>
<p>Adding and multiplying is identical to adding and multiplying to binomials
together except instead of having an x squared and y squared stick around, we
can simplify the resulting expression using rule number 1 above. For example if
we have two complex numbers <code>(a + bi)</code> and <code>(c + di)</code> we can add them together
to get <code>(a + c)</code> as the <code>real</code> component and <code>(b + d)i</code> for the <code>imaginary</code>
component.</p>
<p>To multiply the above components, its similar but we must apply the &quot;foil&quot;
multiplication of binomials:</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">First: a * c +
Outer: a * di +
Inner: bi * c +
Last: bi * di</code>
</pre>
<p>Notice that the first and last products simplify down to real numbers. Trivially
with the first, and with last the i's multiply together to give us -1. So the
<code>real</code> component of multiplying the two complex numbers together is equal to
<code>a * c - b * d</code>. And just as before since we can't factor the i out of the Outer
and Inner parts, the <code>imaginary</code> component becomes <code>a * di + c * bi</code>.</p>
<p>Lets build this in Rust.</p>
<h2 id="rust-operator-overloading">Rust Operator Overloading</h2>
<p>The <code>Complex</code> struct is very simple, composed of two 64 bit floats.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">#[derive(PartialEq, Copy, Clone)]
pub struct Complex {
    pub real: f64,
    pub imaginary: f64
}</code>
</pre>
<p>Importantly I derive the implementations of Clone and Copy to give the final
objects copy semantics. This means that any time the variable is passed around,
the struct is copied instead of borrowed.</p>
<p>In rust operators are overloaded for a given struct by implementing the traits
found in <code>std::ops</code>. In our case we only need <code>Add</code> and <code>Mul</code>.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">impl Add for Complex {
    type Output = Complex;

    fn add(self, rhs: Complex) -&gt; Complex {
        Complex {
            real: self.real + rhs.real,
            imaginary: self.imaginary + rhs.imaginary
        }
    }
}

impl Mul for Complex {
    type Output = Complex;

    fn mul(self, rhs: Complex) -&gt; Complex {
        Complex {
            real: self.real * rhs.real - self.imaginary * rhs.imaginary,
            imaginary: self.real * rhs.imaginary + self.imaginary * rhs.real
        }
    }
}</code>
</pre>
<p>These mirror the above calculations exactly. Note the type parameter <code>Output</code>
which tells the Rust compiler that these operators should return <code>Complex</code>
instances.</p>
<p>Lastly finding the length of a complex number is useful when trying to decide if
a given point is escaping to infinity. We define the length as the Cartesian
distance from the origin of the complex plane. Simply put, it is the square root
of the real component squared plus the imaginary component squared. For our
purposes, a simple optimization can be made by not actually taking the square
root in the length calculation.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">impl Complex {
    pub fn length_squared(self) -&gt; f64 {
        self.real * self.real + self.imaginary * self.imaginary
    }
}</code>
</pre>
<h2 id="using-the-dsl">Using the DSL</h2>
<p>To draw something to the screen, we will split the calculation into two parts:
the complex arithmetic in Rust and interpreting the results in JavaScript. Since
we don't want the JavaScript side to have to worry about the complex numbers at
all, I decided to do the viewport transform on the Rust side. So the mandle
function would take an x and y coordinate which moves from the top left corner
to the bottom right row by row, and a width and height value. Then the Rust code
transforms those values to fit a roughly 3 by 3 unit square centered slightly
left of the origin. This gives a satisfying full view of the Mandelbrot fractal.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">#[no_mangle]
pub fn mandle(x: f64, y: f64, width: usize, height: usize) -&gt; i32 {
    let c = Complex {
        real: x * 3.0 &#x2F; (width as f64) - 2.25,
        imaginary: y * 3.0 &#x2F; (height as f64) - 1.5
    };

    iterate(c, c, 0)
}</code>
</pre>
<p>Finally iterate is defined as a recursive function that repeatedly applies the
function <code>Z = Z * Z + C</code> to the initial state of <code>C</code> transformed from the
JavaScript side's coordinates. The function stops and reports how many loops it
made if either the length of <code>Z</code> becomes greeted than 4 (16 in our case since we
don't square root the length) or we do n iterations without escaping.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">fn iterate(z: Complex, c: Complex, n: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    if n &gt;= 100 {
        return n;
    }

    if z.length_squared() &gt; 16.0 {
        return n;
    }

    iterate(z * z + c, c, n + 1)
}</code>
</pre>
<p>And thats it for the math. You made it.</p>
<h2 id="draw-something-already">Draw Something Already</h2>
<p>Now to see something on the screen. First we need something to draw on, so I
added a canvas to the html page and initialized a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">2d drawing
context</a>. </p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">const canvas = document.getElementById(&#x27;canvas&#x27;);
const ctx = canvas.getContext(&#x27;2d&#x27;);</code>
</pre>
<p>I also define a button for future use to redraw the Mandelbrot.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;.&#x2F;index.js&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;script&gt;
    &lt;canvas id=&quot;canvas&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;canvas&gt;
    &lt;button onclick=&quot;draw()&quot;&gt;Redraw&lt;&#x2F;button&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;body&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;html&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>Then I define a draw function which calls mandle for each pixel and draws a
single pixel wide and tall rectangle with the results. For color I simply use
whether the result is even or odd. This is a quick way to get an interesting
image, but there is much more that could be done to add color. For now this is
good enough.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">const width = 400;
const height = 400;

function draw() {
  for (let y = 0; y &lt; height; y += 1) {
    for (let x = 0; x &lt; width; x += 1) {
      let n = mandle(x, y, width, height);
      let color = n % 2 == 0 ? &quot;black&quot; : &quot;white&quot;;
      ctx.fillStyle = color;
      ctx.fillRect(x, y, 1, 1);
    }
  }
}

draw();

window.draw = draw;</code>
</pre>
<p>Refreshing the browser window presents us with:</p>
<p><img src="https://kaylees.dev/trio/oak/day13-rusty-mandelbrot/./Pixelated.PNG" alt="Pixelated" /></p>
<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>
<p>This is awesome, but we can do better. The draw button doesn't work because the
browser is too busy calculating everything to return control to the renderer.
Similarly, things look pretty pixelated. The color choices don't help, but a
little bit of anti aliasing goes a long way with Mandelbrot fractals. Lets fix
that first.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">const samplesPerPixel = 100;

function draw() {
  let i = 0;
  for (let y = 0; y &lt; height; y += 1) {
    for (let x = 0; x &lt; width; x += 1) {
      let c = 0;

      for (let s = 0; s &lt; samplesPerPixel; s++) {
        let n = mandle(x + Math.random(), y + Math.random(), width, height);
        c += n % 2;
      }

      let gray = Math.floor(c * 255 &#x2F; samplesPerPixel);
      ctx.fillStyle = &quot;rgb(&quot; + gray + &quot;, &quot; + gray + &quot;, &quot; + gray + &quot;)&quot;;
      ctx.fillRect(x, y, 1, 1);
    }
  }
}</code>
</pre>
<p>The basic idea is instead of using one sample of the complex plane per pixel, we
can randomly select a bunch of samples and average the results together.
Experimentally I found that 100 samples is a pretty good compromise. In
practice, the majority of the time spent in our Mandelbrot renderer currently is
taken up crossing the barrier between Rust and JavaScript, so doing more
calculation on the Rust side doesn't actually make the render much slower.</p>
<p><img src="https://kaylees.dev/trio/oak/day13-rusty-mandelbrot/./Smooth.PNG" alt="Smooth" /></p>
<p>MUCH better. Now for the other piece. It would be awesome if we could see the
image draw as it goes. To handle this, I decided to use some modern JavaScript
features and build an async version of sleep.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">function sleep()  {
  return new Promise(resolve =&gt; setTimeout(resolve));
}</code>
</pre>
<p>And convert our draw function to be async, and every chunk of about 1000 pixels,
yield to the browser so that it can draw to the screen.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">async function draw() {
  let i = 0;
  for (let y = 0; y &lt; height; y += 1) {
    for (let x = 0; x &lt; width; x += 1) {
      let c = 0;

      for (let s = 0; s &lt; samplesPerPixel; s++) {
        let n = mandle(x + Math.random(), y + Math.random(), width, height);
        c += n % 2;
      }

      let gray = Math.floor(c * 255 &#x2F; samplesPerPixel);
      ctx.fillStyle = &quot;rgb(&quot; + gray + &quot;, &quot; + gray + &quot;, &quot; + gray + &quot;)&quot;;
      ctx.fillRect(x, y, 1, 1);

      i++;
      if (i &gt; chunkSize) {
        i = 0;
        await sleep();
      }
    }
  }
}</code>
</pre>
<p>In a normal build system, this would work and everything would be roses.
Unfortunately there is an outstanding bug in the Parcel Bundler which over
utilizes the Babel transpiler. So instead of our beautiful Mandelbrot fractal we
are presented with a blank page and this error in the log:</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">index.js:15 Uncaught (in promise) ReferenceError: regeneratorRuntime is not defined
    at _draw (index.js:15)
    at draw (index.js:15)
    at Object.parcelRequire.index.js..&#x2F;SkyLight.rs (index.js:39)
    at newRequire (SkyLight.e31bb0bc.js:49)
    at localRequire (SkyLight.e31bb0bc.js:55)
    at index.js:41</code>
</pre>
<h2 id="helping-parcel-along">Helping Parcel Along</h2>
<p>After some searching on the web I found that the quickest fix was to lean in,
and provide the translator what it wants. I did this by installing some babel
dependencies using:</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">yarn add babel-plugin-transform-runtime babel-core -D</code>
</pre>
<p>As well as adding a .babelrc file with:</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">{
    &quot;plugins&quot;: [
        [&quot;transform-runtime&quot;,
        {
            &quot;polyfill&quot;: false,
            &quot;regenerator&quot;: true
        }]
    ]
}</code>
</pre>
<p>And lastly adding this to the top of the JavaScript file to initialize it all:</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">import &quot;babel-polyfill&quot;;</code>
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately I have found errors such as these to be pretty common when pushing
the edges of what Parcel supports. I am hopeful that these things will get
simpler over time, but for now fixes like the above work well enough.</p>
<p>A final refresh gives us the demo I have embedded at the top of this post!
Refresh smoothly draws a clear Mandelbrot image to the canvas, and repeat clicks
will redraw over and over.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>For a simple Web Assembly demo, this build system is extremely quick and clean.
I have found a couple of frustrations occasionally but overall I am extremely
pleased using Parcel. The comforting thing is that if I ever need to fall back,
there are other more configurable options. However so long as I can get away
with it, Parcel's no configuration approach is very nice.</p>
<p>Although this project isn't associated with a project in particular, I plan on
using this framework and setup in future posts. More like this to come!</p>
<p>Till tomorrow,<br />
