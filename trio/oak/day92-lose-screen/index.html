<p>Today I worked on the game over screen in my Tetris Attack clone. I built upon the work I layed out yesterday to enable
multiple screens, and I created a danger animation for blocks about to move off the top of the screen. The screen
management code was largely covered yesterday, so today I will talk about the danger animation I built.</p>
<p><img src="https://kaylees.dev/trio/oak/day92-lose-screen/./DangerBlocks.gif" alt="Danger Blocks" /></p>
<h2 id="the-flicker">The Flicker</h2>
<p>The flickering block effect is simply a manipulation of the tint of each block in columns which are about to move off
the screen. I build this effect by adding a Sin wave based on the current frame count to the tint color. By fiddling
with the scale of the frame count value, I can effect the speed of the flicker, and by multiplying the result by some
value, I can configure the brightness differenctial from the darkest level to the brightest.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-en">calculateColor(centerY: number, frame: number, dangerColumns: Set&lt;number&gt;) {
    if (this.state === BlockState.Matched) {
      return new Color(1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1);
      ...
      ...
      ...
    } else if (isInLosingPosition() &amp;&amp; dangerColumns.has(this.gridSlot.x)) {
      return Color.gray;
    } else if (dangerColumns.has(this.gridSlot.x)) {
      let gray = 1 + Math.sin(frame &#x2F; 5) &#x2F; 4;
      return new Color(gray, gray, gray);
    } else {
      return Color.white;
    }
  }</code>
</pre>
<p>The added bits are the 3 last clauses of the if else statement in my calculate color function for blocks. I calculate
the danger columns by looping over every block and checking the y position. This gets passed to every block render
function and by extension every calculate color function.</p>
<p>Since the frame value increments every frame (obviously) I can divide it by some constant value to get a smoother number
which slowly increases. Also since the Sin function moves from negative one to positive one, I can tell that 
<code>Sin(frame / 5) / 4</code> will go from -0.25 to 0.25 and adding 1 will result in 0.75 to 1.25 which is right where I want it. 
This means the animation will move smoothly from slightly darker to slightly brighter than normal.</p>
<p>If however any of the columns are in the losing position which means the final count down timer has started, I render
all danger columns as darker than normal. This alerts the player that they are about to lose unless they do something
quickly.</p>
<h2 id="next-up">Next Up</h2>
<p>Its very late (again :/) so I'm gonna leave it at that. I have mixed feelings about this strategy for game screens. I'm
concidering introducing react to enable more UI first components and the like and ease interface design. I haven't
decided though as normal web controls are pretty hard to theme to match the pixel art. We'll see.</p>
<p>In any case the game is shaping up. The biggest feature next is to add multiplayer support. I have a bunch of
interesting ideas kicking around, so I'm eager to get going.</p>
<p>Till tomorrow,<br />
Kaylee</p>
